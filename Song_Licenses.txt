	"I can't give you a formal license (legal paperwork) for it, but as long as it's non-commercial I can give you my personal blessing and guarantee that you won't get in trouble for using it :) If that's enough just feel free to use any of my tracks. Please credit the music properly though, and include a link to www.amethystium.com and www.am.mu (it's the same site right now, but the latter will be a label/music store site soon).
Best regards,
�ystein Ramfjord"
